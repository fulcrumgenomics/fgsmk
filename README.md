Supporting functions for running Snakemake workflows.

## Recommended Installation

Install the Python package and dependency management tool [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) using official documentation.
You must have Python 3.11 or greater available on your system path, which could be managed by [`mamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html), [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), or another package manager. 
Finally, install the dependencies of the project with:

```console
poetry install
```

To check successful installation, run:

```console
poetry run fgsmk hello --name Fulcrum
```

## Installing into a Mamba Environment

Install the Python package and dependency management tool [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) and the environment manager [`mamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html) using official documentation.
Create and activate a virtual environment with Python 3.11 or greater:

```console
mamba create -n fgsmk python=3.11
mamba activate fgsmk
```

Then, because Poetry will auto-detect an activated environment, install the project with:

```console
poetry install
```

To check successful installation, run:

```console
fgsmk hello --name Fulcrum
```
